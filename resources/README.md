## 8 Bit Deck

A few years back I bought **The 8Bit Deck: A pixel art playing card deck** from Michael B. Myers Jr. See it on my [Playing Cards](https://alexhedley.com/playingcards/) site.

I recently found that they had been made available to purchase as an assets set, $2 how could I not! Now to add them to the site.
